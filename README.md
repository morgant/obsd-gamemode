# obsd-gamemode - GameMode for OpenBSD

Set performance and quality-of-life settings for running more demanding games on OpenBSD. Inspired by [GameMode for Linux](https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode). This is more limited in scope and doesn't reach into CPU governor or GPU performance tweaks.

This takes care of the following settings for the application:
- CPU to high performance mode (`apm -H`)
- datasize limit high (typically to all physically available memory)
- high mesa shader cache size (should reduce stutter due to shader compilation)

One of the main advantages is that it saves the baseline settings prior to launch and returns to them after program execution is completed.

## Usage

```
gamemoderun.sh command [args]
```

## Limitations

This is only for 1 concurrent game process, as it will end the performance settings (at least apm(1) settings) when any instance of this script exits.

May or may not work with [obsdfreqd](https://git.sr.ht/~solene/obsdfreqd).

## Possible future additions

- Debating about making a daemon, which would allow the following:
  - renice(8)/setpriority(2) to prioritize the game process
  - handling multiple games/programs being run in gamemode (would keep a list, and remain active until the last one has exited)
- Hybrid GPU handling via `DRI_PRIME`, if that works on OpenBSD (untested so far; may need xorg.conf tweaks)
